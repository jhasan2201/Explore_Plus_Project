        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and Explore Plus that govern the right to use the websites, applications, and other offerings from Explore Plus (collectively, the “Explore Plus Platform”). When used in these Terms, “Explore Plus,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to the Explore Plus entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting.

            The Explore Plus Platform enables users (“Members”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services.
            Members who publish and offer services are “Hosts” and Members who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.”
            Hosts offer accommodations (“Accommodations”), activities, excursions, and events (“Experiences”), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, “Host Services,” and each Host Service offering, a “Listing”).
            As the provider of the Explore Plus Platform, Explore Plus does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host Services. Explore Plus is not a party to the contracts entered into directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is Explore Plus a real estate broker, travel agency, or insurer. </p>
